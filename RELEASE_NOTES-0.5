CHANGES TO BE AWARE OF FOR batv-tools 0.5

The X-Batv-Status header has been enhanced to include the reason for invalidity:

	X-Batv-Status: valid
	X-Batv-Status: invalid, missing
	X-Batv-Status: invalid, bad-signature
	X-Batv-Status: invalid, multiple-rcpt

In the future we may add additional information to these headers. Please
ensure your scripts consider any X-Batv-Status header STARTING WITH
"valid" as valid, and any X-Batv-Status header STARTING WITH "invalid"
as invalid.  DO NOT match the entire value.

batv-milter now adds 'X-Batv-Status: invalid, bad-signature' to any bounce
(i.e. message with null envelope sender) which isn't addressed to a BATV
address (previously it added no X-Batv-Status header to such messages).
Because of this change, it is now recommended that your filters discard
any message WITH a 'X-Batv-Status: invalid' header, rather than discarding
any bounce WITHOUT a 'X-Batv-Status: valid' header as previously
recommended by the documentation.  It is highly recommended that you
consult doc/filtering.txt, which has been substantially rewritten.

batv-milter has a new option 'on_invalid'.  Set it to 'reject' for
batv-milter to reject backscatter at SMTP time.

batv-tools now has mailing lists:

	Announce list:  http://lists.cloudmutt.com/mailman/listinfo/batv-tools-announce
	Discuss list:   http://lists.cloudmutt.com/mailman/listinfo/batv-tools-discuss

If you use batv-tools please consider subscribing to one or both of these
lists to stay abreast of (and provide input to) batv-tools development.
