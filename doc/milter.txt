batv-milter is a complete solution intended for system administrators
who want to provide BATV to an entire domain of users.  It integrates
with the MTA to sign all outgoing mail and validate the BATV addresses
of incoming mail.  It has been developed and tested with Postfix, but
should work in other milter-supporting MTAs like Sendmail.

For documentation on getting up-and-running with the milter, see
doc/quickstart.milter.txt.

By default, the milter adds a 'X-Batv-Status: invalid, ...' header
to invalid bounces instead of outright rejecting them.  Consult
doc/filtering.txt for documentation about filtering based on this header.
If you'd rather reject invalid bounces at SMTP time, set the batv-milter
configuration option 'on-invalid' to 'reject'.


POSTFIX NOTES

By default, Postfix does not apply milters to bounces it generates
internally.  Consequentially, locally-generated bounces will not be
validated with batv-milter, nor tagged with a X-Batv-Status header.
To change this behavior, you can set the following Postfix option:

	internal_mail_filter_classes = bounce

Warning: the Postfix documentation says of this option: "It's generally
not safe to enable content inspection of Postfix-generated email
messages. The user is warned."

In general, setting this option is not necessary; you don't need to
validate local bounces since they're trusted anyways, and as long as you
only discard mail WITH a 'X-Batv-Status: invalid' header (rather than
discarding mail WITHOUT a 'X-Batv-Status: valid' header), you shouldn't
have any problems.
