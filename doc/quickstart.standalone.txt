This document describes how a non-administrative user can get up and
running with BATV using the standalone tools.  If you're an administrator
looking to configure the BATV milter, see quickstart.milter.txt.


0. REQUIREMENTS

	1. You must use an email service provider that supports
	   sub-addressing (also known as "plus" addressing).  This guide
	   assumes your email provider uses the '+' character as the
	   sub-address delimiter.  Consult the documentation for the
	   individual 'batv-' commands if your provider uses a different
	   character.

	2. You must be able to configure your MUA to send mail using
	   a custom sendmail-compatible command.  Most MUAs can do this.

	3. You must be able to filter your incoming mail through an
	   arbitrary command.  If you use procmail you can do this.

	4. Your MTA must add a header to incoming messages that contains
	   the envelope recipient.  Postfix uses the 'Delivered-To'
	   header.


1. GENERATE A KEY

	Run this command to generate a key in ~/.batv-key:

		batv-keygen


2. CONFIGURE YOUR MUA TO USE batv-sendmail

	Configure your MUA to send mail using this command:

		batv-sendmail -f YOURADDRESS ARGS...

	where YOURADDRESS is your email address (e.g. andrew@example.com)
	and ARGS... are additional arguments to sendmail that your MUA
	normally sends (e.g. -i and -t).

	If you use pine/alpine, this is what you must add to ~/.pinerc:

		sendmail-path=batv-sendmail -f YOURADDRESS -t -i

	If you use mutt, this is what you must add to ~/.muttrc:

		set sendmail = "batv-sendmail -f YOURADDRESS -i"

	For other MUAs, consult the documentation.


3. FILTER INCOMING BOUNCES THROUGH batv-validate

	You should filter all incoming bounces (i.e. those with a null
	Return-Path) through the 'batv-validate -f' command, and then
	discard bounces lacking a 'X-Batv-Status: valid' header.

	If you use procmail, you can accomplish this with the following
	recipe in ~/.procmailrc:

	:0
	* ^Return-Path: <>
	{
		:0hfw
		| batv-validate -f -h Delivered-To

		:0a:
		* !^X-Batv-Status: valid
		/dev/null
	}

	The -h flag to batv-validate specifies the name of the header
	containing the envelope recipient.  'Delivered-To' is the header
	used by Postfix.  Consult your MTA's documentation to determine
	the header name.

	batv-validate adds the header 'X-Batv-Status: valid' if the
	message has a valid BATV recipient address.  You can match on
	this header using a later procmail recipe.  In the example above,
	procmail sends bounces lacking this header to /dev/null.  You may
	wish to quarantine such messages in a separate mailbox instead.


ADVANCED CONFIGURATION

	Consult the usage messages for the individual 'batv-' tools
	(e.g. 'batv-validate -?') to learn about advanced configuration
	topics such as:

		* Specifying a different sub-address delimiter
		* Using a different key for different addresses
		* Configuring the lifetime of BATV signatures (defaults
		  to 7 days)
