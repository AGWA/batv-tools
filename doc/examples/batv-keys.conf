# Sample batv-keys.conf file.
# This file specifies a mapping from domain/address to key file.
# BATV is only enabled for users/domains specified in this file.
# Key files should consist of 64 bytes of random data, and can be
# generated with:
#  batv-keygen -f keyfile

# Blank lines and lines starting with '#' are ignored.

# Typical mapping for all addresses at example.com (but not sub-domains):
#@example.com		/etc/batv-key.example.com

# Also map addresses at sub.example.com:
@sub.example.com	/etc/batv-key.sub.example.com

# You can also specify individual address.  These always take precedence
# over domain mappings, regardless of order in this file.
#andrew@example.com	/etc/batv-key.andrew

# You can specify an empty key file (e.g. /dev/null) to disable BATV
# for a particular user:
#bob@example.com	/dev/null
