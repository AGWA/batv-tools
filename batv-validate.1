batv-validate \- Validate the signature of a BATV address
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.nf
\fBbatv-validate\fR [\fIoptions\fR ...] \fIbatvaddress\fR

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBbatv-validate\fR validates the signature of a BATV address that has been generated by batv-sign(1), batv-sendmail(1), batv-milter(1), or another BATV implementation.  Using batv-validate, you can determine whether a bounce is valid and should be accepted, or backscatter that should be discarded.

There are three ways to use \fBbatv-validate\fR.  The first way is to specify the address to validate as a command line argument, \fIbatvaddress\fR.  The validity of the address is indicated by the exit code of batv-validate.  The second way, enabled with the \fB-m\fR option, is to pass an email message to stdin.  The BATV address is extracted from a header of the message (such as Delivered-To), and its validity is indicated by the exit code of batv-validate.  The third way, filter mode, enabled with the \fB-f\fR option, is to pass an email message to stdin.  As with \fB-m\fR, the BATV address is extracted from a header of the message.  The email message is copied through to stdout, and the validity of the BATV address is indicated by adding an X-Batv-Status header, described below, to the copied message.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
.BI \-m
Enable mailbox input mode.  Instead of specifying the BATV address to validate as a command line argument, batv-validate reads an email message from stdin and extracts the address to validate from a header (see \fB-h\fR option below).  batv-validate accepts either a complete email message, or just the message headers.  If the first line of the input starts with "From ", it is ignored.
.TP
.BI \-f
Enable filter mode.  Instead of specifying the BATV address to validate as a command line argument, batv-validate reads an email message from stdin and extracts the address to validate from a header (see \fB-h\fR option below).  The email message is copied through to stdout, and the validity of the BATV address is indicated by adding an X-Batv-Status header, described below, to the copied message.  batv-validate accepts either a complete email message, or just the message headers.
.TP
.BI \-k\ \fIkeyfile\fR
Use the key in \fIkeyfile\fR.  Use batv-keygen(1) to generate a key.  (Default: ~/.batv-key)
.TP
.BI \-K\ \fIkeymapfile\fR
Use the key map file in \fIkeymapfile\fR.  (Default: ~/.batv-keys)
.TP
.BI \-l\ \fIlifetime\fR
Lifetime, in days, of the signature. (Default: 7)
.TP
.BI \-d\ \fIdelimiter\fR
Use \fIdelimiter\fR as the sub address delimiter of the signed BATV address.  \fIdelimiter\fR must be a single character and must be recognized by \fIfromaddress\fR's MTA as a sub address delimiter.  (Default: +)
.TP
.BI \-h\ \fIrcptheader\fR
Extract the BATV address to validate from the given header.  This header should be added by your MTA and should contain the envelope recipient of the message.  (Default: "Delivered-To")
.SH "EXIT STATUS"
Except when filter mode is enabled, batv-validate uses one of the following exit codes to indicate the result of the validation.  Any other exit code indicates an error.
.TP
.BI 0
This message is addressed to a BATV address with a valid signature.  It can be considered a legitimate bounce.
.TP
.BI 10
This message is addressed to a BATV address with an incorrect signature. It should be considered backscatter and be discarded.
.TP
.BI 11
This message is not addressed to a BATV address.  It should be considered backscatter and be discarded.
.SH "X-BATV-STATUS HEADER"
When filter mode is enabled (-f option), batv-validate places one of the following values in the X-Batv-Status header to indicate the result of the validation:
.TP
.BI valid
This message is addressed to a BATV address with a valid signature.  It can be considered a legitimate bounce.
.TP
.BI invalid,\ bad-signature
This message is addressed to a BATV address with an incorrect signature. It should be considered backscatter and be discarded.
.TP
.BI invalid,\ missing
This message is not addressed to a BATV address.  It should be considered backscatter and be discarded.
.LP
Future versions of batv-tools may include additional information in the X-Batv-Status header, so you should assume any header value starting with "valid" means valid, and any header value starting with "invalid" means invalid.
