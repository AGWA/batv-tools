[Common] Improve docs, write manpages, etc.

[Milter] Config options to specify the exact socket owner/group (to be effected before dropping privileges)

[Milter] Logging so we know when something goes wrong (syslog or just redirect stderr to a log file)

[Common] Figure out better way to do expiration checking
	right now lifetime needs to be known on both signing side and verifying side
	perhaps cap the lifetime to 500 days and assume any difference greater than 500 is a wraparound when verifying?
		actually 500 is too big... cap it lower and be very strict when verifying
	unfortunately the standard is unspecific how this should work

[Common] Ability to specify keys directly in keymap file (in hex form) (useful for procmail filter)
	If value starts with / -> assume it's a file path and read it
	Otherwise -> assume it's hex data and parse it

[Milter] Ability to negate internal address
	Idea: prefix with !

[Common] Question: When checking batv_senders list, should we stop at + (or other configurable delimiter)???
	i.e. so andrew@example.com also matches andrew+foo@example.com

[Common] Key rollover support

[Common] Config_error is becoming more about just config errors, but also initialization errors.  Rename it?

[Milter] chdir to / when daemonizing

[Common] Abstract away address type (e.g. prvs) handling

[Common] Put common code into a "libbatv" which other apps (e.g. MUAs) could link with

[Common] Use exclusively "validate" terminology instead of "verify" (the V in BATV stands for validation)

[Milter] Set a rejection message when rejecting backscatter

[Milter] Rejections should take place in response to RCPT TO, not DATA
