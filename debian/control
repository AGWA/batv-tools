Description: Standalone tools for Bounce Address Tag Validation
 Bounce Address Tag Validation (BATV) is a method for detecting and blocking
 backscatter.  It works by embedding a cryptographic token in the envelope
 sender of all outgoing mail, and checking incoming bounces for a valid token.
 This package contains standalone tools that enable individual users to
 use BATV.  System administrators should see the batv-milter package for a
 solution that can be integrated with the system's MTA.

Description: Milter (mail filter) for Bounce Address Tag Validation
 Bounce Address Tag Validation (BATV) is a method for detecting and blocking
 backscatter.  It works by embedding a cryptographic token in the envelope
 sender of all outgoing mail, and checking incoming bounces for a valid token.
 This package contains a milter implementation of BATV that can be integrated
 with a milter-compatible MTA such as Postfix or Sendmail to provide BATV to
 an entire domain of users.  Individual users should see the batv-tools package
 for a solution that does not require involvement of the system administrator.
