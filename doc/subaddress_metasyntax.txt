batv-tools supports an alternative address meta-syntax based on
sub-addressing (aka "plus" addressing).  Instead of rewriting the entire
local part of the email address, the BATV token is appended to the local
part after a sub-address delimiter (typically '+' or '-').  For example:

	andrew+prvs=9352e50792@example.com

Since many mail systems support sub-addressing, this syntax permits
BATV-signed mail to be routed through mail servers that have no knowledge
of BATV.  This has a couple advantages:

  1. Backup MX servers which accept mail only for known recipients
     need not support BATV.  As long as they support sub-addressing,
     mail destined to BATV addresses will be accepted.  (In contrast,
     the standard meta-syntax appears to the backup MX server as an
     unknown recipient, meaning the backup MX server must either accept
     all mail regardless of recipient (a bad idea), or support BATV
     (not always feasible).)

  2. It lets individual users use BATV with support from their MUA and/or
     MDA, without the MTA needing to support BATV.

The standalone BATV tools support only the non-standard sub-address syntax
(otherwise MTA support would be required).  The milter uses the standard
syntax by default but may be configured to use sub-address syntax.
