batv-milter is a complete solution intended for system administrators
who want to provide BATV to an entire domain of users.  It integrates
with the MTA to sign all outgoing mail and validate the BATV addresses
of incoming mail.  It has been developed and tested with Postfix, but
should work in other milter-supporting MTAs like Sendmail.

For documentation on getting up-and-running with the milter, see
quickstart.milter.txt.

Note that the milter does NOT reject any incoming mail or attempt
to determine what's a bounce and what isn't; it merely validates and
rewrites BATV addresses.  The result of the validation ('valid' or
'invalid') is placed in the X-Batv-Status header.  See filtering.txt
for tips and examples for filtering backscatter based on this header.


POSTFIX NOTES

By default, Postfix does not apply milters to bounces it generates
internally.  Consequentially, locally-generated bounces will not be tagged
with a X-Batv-Status header.  To change this behavior, you can set the
following Postfix option:

	internal_mail_filter_classes = bounce

Warning: the Postfix documentation says of this option: "It's generally
not safe to enable content inspection of Postfix-generated email
messages. The user is warned."
