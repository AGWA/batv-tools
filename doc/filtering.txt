batv-tools does not itself identify bounces or discard or reject any mail.
It is up to the user to identify bounces and filter those which lack a
'X-Batv-Status: valid' header.

batv-tools is designed this way to give the user maximum flexibility,
since some users may prefer to quarantine backscatter, while others may
prefer to discard it.  batv-tools avoids hard-coding bounce detection
logic, since some users may wish to use BATV to filter bounce-like
messages that don't have a null envelope sender, such as some vacation
auto-replies.  Letting the user control this detection logic (for example,
with procmail) is more reasonable than including detection logic for
every possible bounce-like message in batv-tools.

In general, you want to filter any message which has a 'Return-Path: <>'
header that *doesn't* have a 'X-Batv-Status: valid' header.  Note that
matching 'X-Batv-Status: invalid' is insufficient, since a bounce which
wasn't addressed to a BATV address at all won't have a X-Batv-Status
header.

Make sure you apply your filtering *after* batv-milter/batv-validate
has run, so you're sure the X-Batv-Status header has been added.


FILTERING USING PROCMAIL

The following procmail recipe can be used to filter bounces that have
been identified as backscatter by batv-tools:

	:0:
	* ^Return-Path: <>
	* !^X-Batv-Status: valid
	/dev/null

You may of course choose to quarantine backscatter in a mailbox instead
of sending it to /dev/null.


FILTERING USING SPAMASSASSIN

The following SpamAssassin rules can be used to filter bounces that
have been identified as backscatter by batv-tools.  These rules assign a
score of 10 to backscatter. You can adjust this number to suit your fancy.

header BATV_VALID               X-Batv-Status =~ /^valid$/
score BATV_VALID                -0.001
describe BATV_VALID             Message has a valid BATV signature

header __BOUNCE                 Return-Path:addr =~ /^$/
meta BACKSCATTER                __BOUNCE && !BATV_VALID
describe BACKSCATTER            Bounce is bogus because it lacks valid BATV sig
score BACKSCATTER               10

Warning: the BACKSCATTER rule doesn't work when SpamAssassin is run from
spamass-milter because the Return-Path header does not exist at that
point.  As a result, the BACKSCATTER rule triggers even for non-bounces.
Avoid using this rule from spamass-milter.
